linked lists:

stack implementation:
- dynamic array or list
- dynamic array:
- faster because you dont allocate elements that often
- a lot of elements are not used (more space used)
- random access (not used for stacks)


- linked list
 - faster implementation
 - slower beause allocating new elements all the times

 usually O(N) but can be O(1) when using existing list nodes
 dummy heads to check for empty list


 Yes, NSArray is faster than NSSet for simply holding and iterating. As little as 50% faster for constructing and as much as 500% faster for iterating. Lesson: if you only need to iterate contents, don't use an NSSet.
