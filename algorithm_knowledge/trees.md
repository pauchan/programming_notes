# Trees

Tips:

- confirm if a tree is BINARY
- binary tree is not neccessarly a BST, BST is SORTED!!!!

## BST (binary search tree)

- deletion, insertion, lookup - O(logn), O(n2) for pessimistic case (sorted data)
- min element on left
- max element on right

## Heap

- max heap with max as root
- min heap with min as root

## Tree search

- where there is no order -> BFS or DFS
- BFS uses momory because you need to track child nodes of nodes at any given level


## Traversals

(think recursion!!!!)
- preorder - node, left, right
- inorder - left, node, right
- postorder - left, right, node

## Graphs

- one way - directed
- two way - undirected
