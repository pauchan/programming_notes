# Chapter 4: Sorting and searching

Computers spent more time sorting than on anything else

## Applications of sorting:

- sort preprocessing - finding elements is o(logn) if elements are sorted
- closest pair
- uniquiness
- distributions
- how often element appear - sort, do binary search and go left right
- testing for intersection (however this might be done in O(n) by builidng hashes)

## Considerations: 

- complex key
- stability
- increasing or decreasing
