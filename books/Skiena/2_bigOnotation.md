# Chapter two

 Talks mostly about how to count complexity: RAM model of computation and big OH notation

## RAM model of computation 

- operations (+, -, *) counts as single operation
- loops counts as N

## Solvabiliy of problem classes

- For n! -> useless after 20
- 2^n -> useless after 40
- Quadratic -> useless after milion
- Linear, nLogn -> useful until billion

Selection sort, insert sort -> n^2
Serching for a substring in text -> n^2

## Application of logarithms

- Binary search
- Tree representations
- Bitwise representation
