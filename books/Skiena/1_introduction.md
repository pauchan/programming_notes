# Chapter one

introduction to what algorithms are all about, what makes them hard and how can they be divided

Travelling salesman problem: N! Compexity, NP hard problem -> non polynomial solution space and you cannot prove that you found solution in polynomial time (need to go through the whole problem space)

Scheduling problem -> there exist an optimal algorithm -> pick the problem that ends first

Sum of first n elements -> () -> expands to n squared value

How to model the problem:
There is a couple of main types of problem:
- Permutations -> involving order -> n! solutions
- Sets -> involving groups -> 2^n solutions
- Trees, Graphs, Strings

Most of those problems and structures (graphs, tables, strings, arrays) are recursive!
