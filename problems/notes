Design a simple photo stream app  

Given an array (for example, [ 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4 ]), implement methods that

1. returns the number of non-zero elements (4)
2. moves the non-zero elements to the beginning of the array (the rest of the elements don't matter)
  -> both [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0] and [ 4, 1, 3, 2, X, Y, Z ] are valid  


  given an array of words, how to eliminate the duplicates?

You have a simple tree structure Ⓐ and its clone ⓐ.

Each node in the tree has a pointer to it's parent as well as an array of its children.

Given an original tree's node Ⓑ and cloned tree ⓐ, implement a method that returns ⓑ (the clone of Ⓑ).
(Imagine finding the matching UIButton/UISlider/UIView in a separate cloned view controller.)


a telephone keypad has letters associated with each number (e.g. 2 = abc, 3 = def); given a passphrase of "fb1" (e.g. one that you might use to log into a bank account), come up with an algorithm that would assemble an array that contains all the different possible letter combinations that, when typed into a telephone dial pad, would be equivalent to the original passphrase.  

iOS developers have a "dispatch_after(when, queue, block)" Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) function they can utilize but once it's set up, these calls can not be easily cancelled.

Describe how you might implement a more convenient version of this named "cancellable_dispatch_after"  

Pretend you're given a simple iOS app with a table view and a text field which looks like a search bar. It has methods to call to a remote server to get potential auto complete words. Describe how you would actually implement the iOS side.  


Given nested arrays, write an enumerator class such that next() returns the elements in sequential order, e.g.:
[1,[4,3],6,[5,[1,0]]] -&gt; 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 1, 0
also implement allObjects for this class
